# About Me

Welcome, you've reached the about page. As you probably already know I am a Azure cloud consultant working on a lot of automation on Azure. I am always looking to automate certain tasks or processes to help myself or my co-workers, hopefully to inspire all who like to do the same. In 2025 I decided to merge my work and home automation blog into one blog, so you can find all my content here.

This blog is mainly for sharing my own ideas, design and/or solutions to problems that you might run into, hopefully to help you out!

If you want to reach out or want to get in touch, feel free to do so via social media. I will try to respond as soon as I can.

Yours truly,

Robin
