# From Jekyll to MkDocs in 2025

Wish you all the best for the new year but I wanted to tell you...

I switched from Jekyll to MkDocs because it is a simple tool to maintain and run. I always ran into gem issues with Jekyll when coming back to it. I also wanted to have a more static site and not have to worry about the dynamic content that Jekyll offers. I will be posting new content about Azure automation (Bicep, PowerShell etc.) soon!

Hope to see you soon!
